      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        I want to people come to the website with a will of desire to know just a little bit about what the website work for, with that in mind I need to catch their attention with a short presentation of the website with enough information for the want to know more about it, I will put an image of the things that the business do so I can put the text below the image and invite them to know more about this business putting a bottom to take them to the "about us" page for the ones that want get more information.</p>
      <p>I hope that visitors want to learn more about what this website has to offer them, I want them that see all the information providers on the page and follow the idea that they can be part of this fictional website.
        To complete what the website wants to offer needs to show the specific things that this web is dedicated to.
        I hope that the clarity and good looking of the site make them stay, I personally use to stay on web pages that look good and I used to avoid those that don't look really good.</p>
