I want to people come to the website with a will of desire to know just a little bit about what the website work for, with that in mind I need to catch their attention with a short presentation of the website with enough information for the want to know more about it, I will put an image of the things that the business do so I can put the text below the image and invite them to know more about this business putting a bottom to take them to the "about us" page for the ones that want get more information.
I want when visitors read the page can feel that this is what they wanted to find, I want to answer all the possible questions that they may have so I want to answer the essential things on the "about us" page trying to be brief so the reading will be not heavy and rough to read to avoid this I will put some pictures that have a relation with what is written and how my propose is to answer all the questions that visitors could have I made a "FAQ" page and they can find the answer for themself in that page, I will use some different sizes so will be more comfortable to find the content.
I hope that visitors want to learn more about what this website has to offer them, I want them that see all the information providers on the page and follow the idea that they can be part of this fictional website.
To complete what the website wants to offer needs to show the specific things that this web is dedicated to.
I hope that the clarity and good looking of the site make them stay, I personally use to stay on web pages that look good and I used to avoid those that don't look really good.
